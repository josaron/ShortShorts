# Vercel Blob Storage
# These are automatically set when you add Vercel Blob to your project
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=

# Upstash Redis (for job tracking in production)
# Get these from https://console.upstash.com/

# Note: In development, job tracking uses in-memory storage
# and video uploads will fail without BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN.
# For local development, you can:
# 1. Use Vercel CLI: `vercel env pull`
# 2. Or create a free Vercel project and add Blob storage
